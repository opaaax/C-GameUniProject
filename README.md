## Overview
This project was developed for *PJC** classes at the **PJATK**.  
It’s a simple **2D game** built entirely in **C++** using the **SFML** library.

## Core Features  
- Player control and interaction: handling keyboard input, updating player state, collision with environment and entities, generating projectiles and player weapons 
- Enemy behavior & traps: moving enemies, static hazards, damage logic  
- Collectibles & shop: pickups scattered through levels, in-game shop offering upgrades  
- Portals & level transitions: teleportation mechanics between areas of the game  
- Structured game loop: initialization, event processing, update logic, rendering, cleanup
